# CSS ASSIGNMENT TWO

# Judging a Book By It's Cover

# DESCRIPTION

- Select an existing book title, new or old, and design a single landing page that will serve as a destination for an advertising campaign. Pick a book with an interesting cover with plenty of fascinating typefaces. Your page will consist of a number of Bootstrap-powered components and user-interface elements.

# INSTRUCTIONS

- Download the latest production release of Bootstrap.
- Find some images of the book cover, the author, other supporting imagery, a synopsis,book reviews, and all the publisher’s information for the book.
- Layout a simple grid-based page that features a photo of the book cover, a photo of the author, at least three reviews, a synopsis or excerpt, a “buy-now” form, the publisher’s information, and perhaps some other related information.
- Incorporate each of the following Bootstrap components into the page:a. Navigation bar (none of the links need to go anywhere, but make themconvincing)b. Carousel (perhaps to cycle through other books by the author?)c. Accordion (a table of contents, perhaps?)d. Tab Panel (publisher’s data, maybe?)
- Use clean, semantic, uncluttered HTML for all Bootstrap components (don’t just take the example code – make it better and simpler where you can)
- Embed some interesting and appropriate web fonts for headings using your own@font-face CSS rules – inspired of course by the book cover (check the font licencing). Use a readable typeface for body copy.
- B- e sure to keep all your own CSS and JS in separate custom files.
- Have fun. Don’t be afraid to experiment a little with this one.

# TAKE IT FURTHER

1. Incorporate some other interactive features into the interface.

2. Attempt to make the page layout suitable for phones, tablets, and desktops.

3. Try to minimize the use of classes and ids from your markup wherever possible by using some more advanced CSS selectors.
