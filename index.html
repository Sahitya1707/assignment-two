                        "Surrounded by Idiots" by Thomas Erikson is an insightful guide to understanding human behavior
                        through a unique and
                        accessible approach. The book introduces four distinct personality types—Red, Yellow, Green, and
                        Blue—that represent
                        different communication and behavior styles. Reds are bold and decisive leaders; Yellows are
                        social and enthusiastic;
                        Greens are calm, empathetic team players; and Blues are analytical and detail-oriented. Through
                        relatable examples,
                        Erikson explains how identifying and adapting to these traits can improve relationships in every
                        aspect of life—whether
                        at work, with friends, or within family dynamics. Surrounded by Idiots empowers readers to
                        embrace personality
                        differences, enhance communication, and foster stronger connections. For anyone who’s ever felt
                        misunderstood or
                        struggled to relate to others, this book provides a straightforward, practical solution to
                        bridging those gaps.</p>

                    <p>Surrounded by Idiots by Thomas Erikson is a practical and entertaining exploration of human
                        personality types and
                        communication styles. The book categorizes people into four color-coded personality types—Red,
                        Yellow, Green, and
                        Blue—each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and ways of interacting. Reds are direct,
                        results-driven, and assertive;
                        Yellows are sociable, spontaneous, and creative; Greens are patient, calm, and supportive; while
                        Blues are analytical,
                        detail-oriented, and structured. By understanding these personality types, readers can learn to
                        adapt their
                        communication approach to connect more effectively with others, reduce misunderstandings, and
                        improve their
                        relationships. Full of relatable anecdotes and actionable insights, Surrounded by Idiots offers
                        a simple yet powerful
                        framework for navigating the complexities of human interaction in both personal and professional
                        settings.</p>

                    <p>"Surrounded by Idiots" by Thomas Erikson is a refreshing take on personality types and
                        communication. Far
                        from labeling people as difficult or 'idiots,' the book presents a fascinating framework
                        using four
                        colors (Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue) to describe a range of personality traits.</p>

                    <p>I believe this book applies more to businesses than personal relationships. I learned a few
                        things and categorized my
                        family and friends into the colors I thought they were. Even if you understand how each color
                        thinks and behaves, it's
                        hard to apply in your personal life. It's good for someone in a leadership position.</p>

                    <p>This is a very entertaining book about personalities. You can definitely name people you know or
                        work with and
                        categorise as we the book. However, it is the blend of the different character traits that is
                        the difficult bit to
                        figure out. It's very rare anyone is a pure xyz. You can probably spot another trait in their
                        character as a blend of
                        two is quite normal.</p>

                    <p>This won’t tell you everything about a person but it will give you a good insight why people are

                        It’s made me reflect on myself and helped me to develop a better understanding of everyone
                        around me and how best to
                        interact with them. For years I couldn’t understand why some people behaved how they do, now
                        it’s so much clearer.</p>

                    <p>I just can't wrap my head around categorizing people into 4 categories. I think people are so
                        much more complex than
                        that. Otherwise, the concept is interesting for sure, and there are definitely some techniques
                        and information that can
                        be useful. Would've liked him to go deeper into people who are mixed colours.</p>

                        each one of us behaves. Great read! A red is the way they are because that’s who they are. They
                        don’t intend to hurt
